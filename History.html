<h2>The Birth of the Cheeseburger</h2>
<h3>It is thought that it all started in the emrging town of Pasadena, California...</h3>
<p>With the recent development of the cattle ranching industry, Americans we able to consume beef on a daily basis.
Although some other people will claim that the Cheeseburger originated in other places, most accept that young Lionel Sternberger was
the braniac behind the madness of the modern day cheeseburger. It was his ingenuity that produced the "cheese" aspect of the already common hamburger.
He slapped a slice of American Cheese in 1926 at his fathers sandwich shop, "The Rite Spot" on a grilling hamburger and thus it was born. Check out the plaque below
that was placed memoriam of his innovation.</p>

<h3>Progression of the Cheeseburger</h3>
<p>After the thought of adding cheese came about, cheeseburgers have flourished to what we know them as now. As you read on the home page, the list
of ingredients are always evolving and no matter how weird they seem to be, someone is able to make it work. Many of the burgers that I didn't want to
    try at first actaully became some of my favorite burger adventures. But with the postives, there are the negatives and there were some that I don't think
    have fully met their potential. Some of the most interesting toppings I have seen are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Peanut Butter and Jelly</li>
    <li>Nutella</li>
    <li>Chocolate covered bacon</li>
    <li>Broccoli and Cheddar</li>
    <li>Sushi</li>
</ul>
