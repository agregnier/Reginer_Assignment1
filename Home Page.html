<h2>Some brief discussion about Cheeseburgers and what they are</h2>
<p>You'll come to notice that burgers can come in every different form, but here are the constants that Cheeseburgers have built on as a foundation:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Bun</li>
    <li>Beef Patty</li>
    <li>Cheese</li>
    <li>Various sauces</li>
    <li>Vegetable Garnish</li>
</ul>
<p> The foundations of the burger have come to evolve over time and have created a culture that has evolved to be an international sensation.
I first fell in love with them growing up in Southern California constantly visiting In'n'out. I feel that In'n'out has set the base of my
burger passion. They never go out of the spectrum of the traditional burger, and from there I have grown to find what works best for burgers
and what doesn't work. I look forward to getting deep in discussion of what makes the burger one of America's favorite dishes.</p>
